### Advent of Code Repository

Included in this repo are all current years of Advent of Code, plus a placeholder for 2022.
Initially I started learning python in 2021, and attempted AoC 2021 and got 7 days in. 7 days was a lot
more than I thought I was going to do! However it started my journey into learning programming in earnest. 
Now, with a small discord of other like-minded individuals from r/learnprogramming, I will be going back and
progressively be doing each past year.

### Needed packages

There are no needed packages to run the solutions themselves, but in order to be able to run the tests you will need `pytest` installed.
